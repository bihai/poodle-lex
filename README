Poodle-Lex is a lexical analyzer generator, similar to lex and its variants.

Usage: python __main__.py RULES_FILE OUTPUT_DIR [Optional arguments]

Required arguments:
RULES_FILE: A file containing token names and pattern definitions
OUTPUT_DIR: An existing directory to which the state machine code is written.

Optional arguments:
-n DOT_FILE, --print-nfa DOT_FILE - Print a GraphViz(.dot) file with the lexical analyzer's NFA representation
-d DOT_FILE, --print-dfa DOT_FILE - Print a GraphViz(.dot) file with the lexical analyzer's DFA representation
-m DOT_FILE, --print-min-dfa DOT_FILE - Print a GraphViz(.dot) file with the lexical analyzer's minimized DFA representation.
-e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING - Encoding of the input file. ENCODING must be an encoding codec name supported by Python.

Rules file:
The rules file is a simple format which describes the lexical analyzer as a set of token definitions, one on each line. The token definitions are described the following way:
TOKEN_ID: PATTERN

Where TOKEN_ID is an alphanumeric ID, and pattern is a regular expression. Additionally any text on a line after "#" is considered a comment.
PATTERN must be surrounded by either single or double quotes. Quotes can be escaped by using double-quotes ("" or '') inside of the pattern. If an "i" appears in front of the opening quote, then the pattern will be interpreted as case-insensitive for ASCII Latin characters.

If a piece of text matches two rules, then the rule appearing first is assumed.

Regular expression rules:
Poodle-Lex patterns use a similar regular expression syntax to the IEEE POSIX ERE standard. The pattern will match the characters present, and the following special characters can be used to define more complex patterns:
".": Matches any Unicode codepoint.
"[...]": Matches one of any characters inside of the brackets
"[^...]": Matches all Unicode codepoints except any characters inside the brackets.
"{m, n}": Matches the previous item if it repeats a minimum of m times and a maximum of n times.
"*": Matches the prevous item if it appears zero or more times in a row.
"+": Matches the previous item if it appears one or more times in a row.
"?": Matches the previous item if it appears zero or one times.
"(...)": Matches the patern within the parenthesis.
"\": Matches the next character literally
"|": Matches either the previous item or the next item.

The following named character classes are also supported:
"[:alnum:]" - Alphanumeric characters ([A-Za-z0-9])
"[:word:]" - Alphanumeric characters + "_" ([A-Za-z0-9_])
"[:alpha:]" - Alphabetical characters ([A-Za-z])
"[:blank:]" - Space and tab ([ \t])
"[:cntrl:]" - ASCII control characters ([\x01-\x1F])
"[:digit:]" - Numerical digits ([0-9])
"[:graph:]" - Visible characters ([\x21-\x7F])
"[:lower:]" - Lowercase characters ([a-z])
"[:print:]" - Printable characters ([\x20-\x7F])
"[:punct:]" - Punctuation ([\]\[\!\"\#\$\%\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\.\/\:\;\<\=\>\?\@\\\^\_\`\{\|\}\~\-])
"[:space:]" - Whitespace characters ([ \t\r\n\v\f])
"[:upper:]" - Uppercase characters ([A-Z])
"[:xdigit:]" - Hexadecimal digits ([A-Fa-f0-9])

Output:
When run, the program generates a FreeBASIC class, Poodle.LexicalAnalyzer, which consumes a stream of Unicode codepoints and produces 
"tokens", a structure containing a token ID and the token's matching text. Also include is code to read UTF and ASCII encoded text and a small demonstration.

Example:
The following generates, compiles, and executes a simple test application on Linux and Windows.
Python 2.7 and FreeBASIC >= 0.90.1 should be installed prior to running. cx_Freeze is required to use setup.py.

Windows:
1) Add the Poodle-Lex installation directory to your PATH environment variable
2) Copy "Test\Test.rules" from the installation directory to any folder
3) Navigate to that folder in the command prompt
4) Enter the following:
mkdir Output
Poodle-Lex Test.rules Output
cd Output\Test
make_test
Test

Linux:
1) Sync the source
2) Install python 2.7
3) install blist (Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-blist)
4) Enter the following from the source directory
mkdir Output
python __main__.py Test/Test.rules Output
cd Output/Test
./make_test.sh
./Test
