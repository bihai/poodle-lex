Poodle-Lex is a lexical analyzer generator, similar to lex.

Usage: python __main__.py RULES_FILE OUTPUT_DIR [Optional arguments]

Required arguments:
RULES_FILE: A file containing token names and pattern definitions
OUTPUT_DIR: An existing directory to which the state machine code is written.

Optional arguments:
-n DOT_FILE, --print-nfa DOT_FILE - Print a GraphViz(.dot) representation of the lexical analyzer's NFA
-d DOT_FILE, --print-dfa DOT_FILE - Print a GraphViz(.dot) representation of the lexical analyzer's DFA
-m DOT_FILE, --print 

Rules file:
The rules file is a simple format which describes the lexical analyzer as a set of token definitions, one on each line. The token definitions are described the following way:
TOKEN_ID: PATTERN

Where TOKEN_ID is an alphanumeric ID, and pattern is a regular expression. Additionally any text on a line after "#" is considered a comment.

Regular expression rules:
Poodle-Lex patterns use a similar regular expression syntax to the IEEE POSIX ERE standard. The pattern will match the characters present, and the following special characters can be used to define more complex patterns:
".": Matches any character, defined as any character appearing in the lexical analyzer.
"[...]": Matches one of any characters inside of the brackets
"[^...]": Matches all but one of any characters inside the brackets, limited to other characters in the lexical analyzer.
"{m, n}": Matches the previous item if it repeats a minimum of m times and a maximum of n times.
"*": Matches the prevous item if it appears zero or more times in a row.
"+": Matches the previous item if it appears one or more times in a row.
"?": Matches the previous item if it appears zero or one times.
"(...)": Matches the patern within the parenthesis.
"\": Matches the next character literally
"|": Matches either the previous item or the next item.

The following named character classes are also supported:
"[:alnum:]" - Alphanumeric characters ([A-Za-z0-9])
"[:word:]" - Alphanumeric characters + "_" ([A-Za-z0-9_])
"[:alpha:]" - Alphabetical characters ([A-Za-z])
"[:blank:]" - Space and tab ([ \t])
"[:cntrl:]" - ASCII control characters ([\x01-\x1F])
"[:digit:]" - Numerical digits ([0-9])
"[:graph:]" - Visible characters ([\x21-\x7F])
"[:lower:]" - Lowercase characters ([a-z])
"[:print:]" - Printable characters ([\x20-\x7F])
"[:punct:]" - Punctuation ([\]\[\!\"\#\$\%\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\.\/\:\;\<\=\>\?\@\\\^\_\`\{\|\}\~\-])
"[:space:]" - Whitespace characters ([ \t\r\n\v\f])
"[:upper:]" - Uppercase characters ([A-Z])
"[:xdigit:]" - Hexadecimal digits ([A-Fa-f0-9])
